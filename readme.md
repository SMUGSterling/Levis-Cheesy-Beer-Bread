# Leviâ€™s Cheesy Beer Bread

*(Makes Two Loaves)*

## Ingredients

* 6 cups self-rising flour
* Â½ cup white sugar
* 2 sticks butter, melted
* 1 (25 oz) can of beer (like Fosterâ€™s) â€” or 2 (12 oz) cans
* 1 lb shredded cheese (avoid hard cheeses like Parmesan)

## Instructions

1.  Preheat oven to 375Â°F (190Â°C).
2.  Grease your pans â€” **really well**. (I use Bakerâ€™s Joy)
3.  Melt the butter and set aside.
4.  In a large bowl, mix the cheese into the flour until evenly coated.
5.  Add the sugar and stir to combine.
6.  Pour in the beer and mix just until combined â€” **do not over-mix**. The batter should be thick and shaggy.
7.  Spoon, drop, or plop the dough into your pans.
    * For large (I recommend disposable) aluminum pans: use two.
    * For smaller bread pans: youâ€™ll need three.
8.  Place pans on a baking sheet â€” *trust me, youâ€™ll want this.* (Butter will escape. Itâ€™s part of the magic.)
9.  Pour melted butter over the top of each loaf â€” one stick per loaf. *Itâ€™ll seem like too much. Itâ€™s not.*
10. *Optional: poke a few holes or shallow cuts to help the butter soak in.*
11. Bake for 1 hour.
12. Rest for 15 minutes before slicing.

## Notes from the Kitchen

* Donâ€™t panic when you see butter bubbling everywhere â€” itâ€™s supposed to look like chaos.
* To reduce oven smoke, pour a bit of water into the baking sheet under the pans.
* Serve warm with herb butter, regular butter, or just as is.

## Perfect With

* A bowl of chili
* A cold night
* Or, you know... sad feelings ðŸ˜…
